# Overview

Runs with the C++ side of the management system and keeps track of info entered when requested. This side of the program manages all input and stores it into a table database. The program queries when needed, if there's any error it automatically pops up with "Item NOT FOUND in Database." to inform the User/Employee it isn't found.

The entire purpose at the end is ultimately facilitating desired information to be stored and queried when needed again. It provides the means of editing and deleting any info when selected choice is executed.

# Relational Database

It's composed into the C++ program yet generated into a MySQL database.

The database is composed into several tables not too complicated. The first set provides the id and event "description". It later lists some potential name of events with the customer. The other table manages the input of Customer name, address, phone, email, Date of Event, Event ID, and Instance cost. In the next tables it simply provides the ability of entering the requested info.
